#
# There is an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order (not
# necessarily with distinct values).
#
# Before being passed to your function, nums is rotated at an unknown pivot
# index k (0 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k],
# nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For
# example, [0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7] might be rotated at pivot index 5 and become
# [4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4].
#
# Given the array nums after the rotation and an integer target, return true if
# target is in nums, or false if it is not in nums.
#
# You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.
#
#
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
# Output: true
# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
# Output: false
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
# -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
# nums is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
# -10^4 <= target <= 10^4
#
#
#
# Follow up: This problem is similar toÂ Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but
# nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How
# and why?

class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        l, r = 0, len(nums)-1

        while l <= r:
            m = (l+r)//2

            if nums[m] == target:
                return True

            while l < m and nums[l] == nums[m]:
                l += 1

            # if the first part is ordered.
            if nums[l] <= nums[m]:
                # target is in first half.
                if nums[l] <= target < nums[m]:
                    r = m-1
                else:
                    l = m+1
            else:
                # target is in second half.
                if nums[m] < target <= nums[r]:
                    l = m+1
                else:
                    r = m-1
        return False
