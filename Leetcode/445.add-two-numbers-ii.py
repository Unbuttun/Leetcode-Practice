# Testcase Example:  '[7,2,4,3]\n[5,6,4]'
#
# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative
# integers. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes
# contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked
# list.
#
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the
# number 0 itself.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [7,2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [7,8,0,7]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
# Output: [8,0,7]
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 9
# It is guaranteed that the list represents a number that does not have leading
# zeros.
#
#
#
# Follow up:Â Could you solve it without reversing the input lists?
#
