 * Testcase Example:  '[["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]'
 *
 * Given an m x n matrix board containing 'X' and 'O', capture all regions that
 * are 4-directionallyÂ surrounded by 'X'.
 *
 * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded
 * region.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: board =
 * [["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","O","X"],["X","X","O","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 * Output:
 * [["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","X","X","X"],["X","O","X","X"]]
 * Explanation: Notice that an 'O' should not be flipped if:
 * - It is on the border, or
 * - It is adjacent to an 'O' that should not be flipped.
 * The bottom 'O' is on the border, so it is not flipped.
 * The other three 'O' form a surrounded region, so they are flipped.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: board = [["X"]]
 * Output: [["X"]]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * m == board.length
 * n == board[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 200
 * board[i][j] is 'X' or 'O'.
