# Testcase Example:  '[1,0,1]'
#
# Given head which is a reference node to a singly-linked list. The value of
# each node in the linked list is either 0 or 1. The linked list holds the
# binary representation of a number.
#
# Return the decimal value of the number in the linked list.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,0,1]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: (101) in base 2 = (5) in base 10
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [0]
# Output: 0
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The Linked List is not empty.
# Number of nodesÂ will not exceed 30.
# Each node's value is eitherÂ 0 or 1.
#
#

# @lc code=start
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def getDecimalValue(self, head: ListNode) -> int:
        current = head
        res = ''

        while current:
            res += str(current.val)
            current = current.next

        return int(res, 2)
