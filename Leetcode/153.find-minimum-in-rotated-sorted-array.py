#
# Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1
# and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might
# become:
#
#
# [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
# [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
#
#
# Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results
# in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
#
# Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum
# element of this array.
#
# You must write an algorithm that runs inÂ O(log n) time.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
# Output: 0
# Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4
# times.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
# Output: 11
# Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4
# times.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == nums.length
# 1 <= n <= 5000
# -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
# All the integers of nums are unique.
# nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.

        while left <= right:
            # if sub array is already sorted, then update the result and break

                break
            mid = (left+right)//2
            res = min(res, nums[mid])
            # if mid is greater than equal to all the left, so we search right
            if nums[mid] >= nums[left]:
                left = mid+1
            else:
                # else search left
                right = mid-1
        return res
